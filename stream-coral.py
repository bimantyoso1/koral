    CoralGuard-AI is an advanced AI-powered system designed to classify the health of coral reefs, distinguishing between healthy and bleached conditions. This initiative is driven by the critical need to monitor and protect coral reef ecosystems, which are increasingly threatened by environmental stressors such as climate change, pollution, overfishing, and coastal development.

    Coral reef resilience refers to the ability of reef ecosystems to resist disturbances and recover while maintaining biodiversity and ecological functions. Instead of merely preventing change, conservation efforts focus on enhancing the reefâ€™s adaptive capacity, ensuring its survival against extreme weather events, mass bleaching, and other ecological challenges. A resilient coral reef functions like a strong immune system, capable of withstanding and recovering from stressors.

    By adopting a holistic management approach, CoralGuard-AI supports reef conservation by integrating AI-driven classification with ecological monitoring. This ensures that efforts to strengthen reef ecosystems remain data-driven, enabling better decision-making in protecting marine biodiversity.
    
    This application helps classify the condition of coral reefs automatically using **AI**.

    **This project was developed by Bimantyoso Hamdikatama**  
    from Universitas Muhammadiyah Surakarta as an effort to support environmental conservation  
    through Deep Learning technology. This application utilizes a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model  
    **to distinguish between healthy and bleached coral reefs based on underwater images.**
